### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Brian Albright


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for work as a web developer.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m working on reinforcing the knowledge I learned in the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin by refactoring projects from the bootcamp in React. 

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that will further the learning process and/or keep my skills up to speed. If I can do that while doing some good like helping a non-profit, all the better. 

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: brian@ondeckconsulting.net

- âš¡ Fun fact: If I'm not at my computer, I'm probably at the park walking Fiona.
